# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

A lightweight and custom mission web for users to save,search and organize their tasks on the internet.

## User stories

As a student, I want to organize my assignments into categories (e.g., homework, exams, group projects) so that I can manage multiple classes efficiently.
As a team leader, I want to create shared mission lists for my team members so that we can collaborate on tasks together in one place.
As a casual user, I want to sort missions by creation date or priority so that I can quickly decide what to do next without overthinking.
As a data-driven user, I want to view my task completion statistics (e.g., success rate, time spent) so that I can track my productivity progress.
As a remote worker, I want to attach useful links or notes to each mission so that I can keep reference materials together with my tasks.
